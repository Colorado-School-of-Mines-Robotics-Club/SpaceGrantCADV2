# SpaceGrantCADV2
A centralized place for all of the new space grant team's CAD files.

This readme will become more organized as we develop standards for the CAD process, but as far as general rules go all files should be in MMGS units. File names should be kept short but descriptive, and subassemblies should be housed in their own folders.
